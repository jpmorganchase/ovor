This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings or communications, written or oral, between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be assigned by J.P. Morgan. The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the right of such party to require such performance at any time in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of such provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety. If any provision of this Agreement is found void or unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that is enforceable and comes closest to the meaning of the original provision. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law. The section headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be considered a part of this Agreement nor be used in its interpretation. All references in this Agreement to the singular shall be deemed to include the plural when the context so requires, and vice versa. Where an expression is defined herein, another part of speech or grammatical form of that expression has a corresponding meaning.
